I am a newcomer to web development, and this is my first app. I am working with php, and unfortunately I feel like I am creating a 2001 app. ;) The goal for the app is relatively straight forward. The first phase is to create a database of plants in my area, with individual species pages through which the user can get information. The second phase is much more ambitious. It is to create a full blown citizen science app with accounts and user uploads and so much more.

Wish me luck.
