							<h2>About EWMA</h2>
							
							<p>The Erwin Wildlife Management Area is a wildlife area located near Corning, NY. It is managed by the New York Department of Environmental 
							Conservation. Management primarily focuses on game species for hunting. However, EWMA is open for multiple uses, including nature observation,
							hiking, and fishing. 
							
							<br>
							<br>
			
							The area offers numerous trails through lowland and upland forests. The visitor can find several ponds in the upland
							areas, and these can be an excellent location for observing animals such as beaver and oprey. Interesting plants can be found here in the various
							habitats. Paper birch is a beautiful any time of the year, but make certain to look for it in the winter.
							
							<br />
							<br />

							<h2>About the EWMA Flora Project</h2>
							
							<p>
							Prior to the Flora Project, there has been no attempt to create a current authoritative enumeration of all the species in the area. Such a project is
							no small task. It requires the dedicated participation of multiple people over a considerable amount of time. Some of the work requires some specialized
							skills or tools, but this does not preclude the ability of non-specialists to participate.
							<br />
							<br />
							The project is, in part, modeled upon aspects of similar projects located throughout the country. Species within EWMA are identified and validated, images are created of
							specimens, data is recorded and then records are created within a central database.
							<br />
							<br />

							<h2>About the EWMAFP App</h2>
							
							<p>
							A public web interface to offer flora enthusiasts the chance to participate in a project with such a goal has had even less momentum. This web application is a public interface which encourages participation in the project by providing a central resource
							for assembling and organizing information pertaining to the flora. 
							
							<br>
							<br>
							
							The first phase of the development of the app focuses on simply providing the public broad access to botanical and ecological information pertaining to EWMA.
							For example, we first wish to provide information to the public about the most commonly encountered flora, such as White Pine and Sensitive Fern. This is a basic
							function of the website. 
							
							<br>
							<br>
							
							At this point in the development cycle, higher level functionality is minimal. For example, the user is not able to contribute directly
							to content stored within the database. However, rest assured that this functionality and more is in the works. The goal is to develop a platform that allows users
							to contribute to the project by submitting coordinate and other data, images and more. In addition, we hope to develop the app as centralized location for members
							to interact with one another.
							
							<br>
							<br>
							
							Another aspect to the app is a dictionary of botanical terms that should be useful to the enthusiast.
